I'm making this because the issue reports have gotten a bit ridiculous at this point. 

1. Do NOT post your error in the issue directly, please use http://hastebin.com/ or http://pastebin.com/
2. Do NOT post the entire description of your error in the title, the title is just a very short explanation.
3. DO post information about the crash you were able to discover in the actual issue text.
4. DO see if the issue occurs with just AS+ and MovingWorld installed, so I know if it's an incompatibility issue.

Here's a basic do and don't.

I'm experiencing a crash when I do x in scenario y, it's not consistent though as it only happens sometimes.
